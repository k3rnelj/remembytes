A very loudly failed attempt to go out of comfort zone. The band did their best, half of the audience was very happy dancing all around.

Too bad you couldn't hear a single word from the vocalist and the fact that someone is playing violin could be noticed only visually (or by plugging your ears to be able to make anything out in the mix). I thought Porcupine Tree in Katowice was absurdly too loud, but this was even worse, and by far. The guy at the mixer was either sleeping or is just too deaf to do his job.

Too bad, this could have been fun, the band did make a good impression in general.

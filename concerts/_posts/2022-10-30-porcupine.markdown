It is the first time in my life when sound quality reuined the whole experience of a concert.

I've heard mistakes, mishaps, accidents, imperfections, but this... this was wrong on all possible levels, prime of them being the level of sound, which was consistently too high over the whole concert. It was too loud already on the quiet bits, and on the more intense ones, it was over the pain threshold, so loud that sticking fingers in your ears actually *enabled* you to make out the words in the vocals for a change.

Which, by all probability is a crying shame, since the intangible (and *inaudible :/*) energy flowing from the stage, the band was great.

I've had some reservations regarding quite narcisistically-sounding remarks spoken by Steven Wilson, including his mention of Katowice being the quietest audience on tour (maybe due to the pain from the speakers?), along with a sugesstion there was still time for us to fix it.

My favourite was the performance of _Anesthetize_, which, by my guess, bore all the sings of a being great one, had one been able to listen to it without plugging something in one's ear ducts.

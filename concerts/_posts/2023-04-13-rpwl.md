One of the best concerts ever witnessed. Firstly, a healthy reminder that Progresja can host a great sound after the horror on the Hunter show a few weeks back. The sound was pristine, nothing missing, everything clear. The earplugs bought after the Hunter disaster stayed in the pocket.

The band makes a great impression with how they interact both with the audience and with each other, the latter in a manner almost like in a jazz band. A fantastic combination of pristine precision and pure fun of playing together.

Never having seen them live before, I found Yogi Lang's live expression very deep, I enjoyed how his whole behavior goes together with the lyrics and you can feel him actually thinking what he's singing. His voice started breaking a little due to a cold, for which he apologized, not really necessarily as he managed to pull everything of in a manner that really gripped your heart if you followed.

Fun details:
- serious middle-aged beer-fueled connoisseurs of music shooting countless photos of the guitarist and basist standing next to each other while the actual solo was played by Lang on a synth <3
- Kalle Wallner(g) was sipping a beer as his drink of choice throughout the whole thing. Didn't stop him from pulling out breathtaking solos anyway.
